# Machine-Learning-Final-Project

## Enviornment
- Python 3.8.16
- It should work directly if you run the code on colab
- To setup the environment yourself, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Training
- To train the model yourself, run the `109550094_Final_inference.ipynb` directly, be sure both `test.csv` and `train.csv` are at the same directory. Since we analysis the data for test and train at the same time, so both two files need to be load even though for training.
- After running the code, it will generate the `model.pkl`, which is the training model.

## Testing
- To test the model, run the  `109550094_Final_inference.ipynb` directly, again, both `test.csv` and `train.csv` are needed to be at the same directory, due to the data preprocessing need both two files. Also, you need to prepare a trained model named `model.pkl`, you can train by yourself or the above also provide a trained model.
